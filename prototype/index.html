                <p>From <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Kendrick-lamar/To-pimp-a-butterfly">genius.com</a>:</p>
                <blockquote><em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em> is Kendrick Lamar’s 
                second major label studio album, and third full-length project. 
                It was released via <strong>Top Dawg Entertainment, Aftermath 
                Entertainment, and Interscope Records</strong>. It followed his 
                critically-acclaimed 2012 debut, <em>good kid, m.A.A.d city</em>. 
                The album was very well-received upon release, eventually 
                earning nine Grammy nominations, and it has gone on to be 
                hailed as one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time.</blockquote>

                <p><em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em> features two poems, one pieced together during the 
                progression of the album, and the other read as one piece during the final track 
                "Mortal Man". The album name is a play on a line from one of the poems: <q>But having 
                a harsh outlook on life, the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out 
                a way to pimp it to its own benefits.</q></p>
            
                <h4>Poems in Full</h4>
                <h5>The First Poem</h5>
                <blockquote>I remember you was conflicted</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Misusing your influence</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Sometimes I did the same</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Abusing my power, full of resentment</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Resentment that turned into a deep depression</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Found myself screaming in the hotel room</blockquote>
                <blockquote>I didn't wanna self destruct</blockquote>
                <blockquote>The evils of Lucy was all around me</blockquote>
                <blockquote>So I went running for answers</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Until I came home</blockquote>
                <blockquote>But that didn't stop survivor's guilt</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was</blockquote>
                <blockquote>But while my loved ones was fighting the</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one</blockquote>
                <blockquote>A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned</blockquote>
                <blockquote>The word was respect</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Doesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets</blockquote>
                <blockquote>If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us</blockquote>
                <blockquote>But I don't know, I'm no mortal man, maybe I'm just another n****</blockquote>
                
                <h5>The Second Poem</h5>
                <blockquote>The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it. It’s only 
                job is to eat or consume everything around it in order to protect itself from this 
                M.a.a.d City. While consuming its environment, the caterpillar begins to notice ways to 
                survive. One thing it notices is how much the world shuns him but praises the butterfly. 
                The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness and the beauty within the 
                caterpillar. But having a harsh outlook on life, the caterpillar sees the butterfly as
                weak and figures out a way to pimp it to its own benefits. Already surrounded by this 
                M.a.a.d City, the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him. 
                He can no longer see past his own thoughts, he’s trapped. While trapped inside these 
                walls certain ideas take root. Such as ‘goin home and bringing back new concepts to this 
                M.a.a.d City.’ The result: wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant. 
                Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered, 
                ending the internal struggle. Although the caterpillar and the butterfly are different. 
                They are one in the same.</blockquote>
