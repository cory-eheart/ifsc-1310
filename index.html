      <h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement </h2>
      <p>Progressive Enhancement is a mindset for web development. Whereas previous approaches to web development focused more on the browser and the capabilites of the user, Progressive Enhancement focuses on the content of the page itself. Start with the content with in the html; mark it up and give it structure. Next, wrap the content in css to give it presentation and color. Finally, add javascript to complete the design.</p>
      <p>I think Progressive Enhancement is important in the current web development cycle. With the wide range of available pieces of tech, from used laptops over a decade old to brand new smartphones, it is important that a method of development be established that does not focus solely on the tech. Web page development should be focused on the content first and foremost, and Progressive Enhancement is the model that makes that distinction. To read more about Progressive Enhancement, please read the following: <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/">"What is Progressive Enhancement and Why it Matters"</a>.</p>
      <h2 id="revision-notes">Revision Notes</h2>
      <p>This class taught me a lot, and I enjoyed it. Having web development under my belt has been a recent goal of mine, as I noticed many job opportunities required some form of HTML and CSS knowledge. As the semester went on, I began to realize I needed a skeleton-structure for my HTML and CSS documents. Memorizing each line of code and what it does is far too difficult, and I plan on building a CSS guide document sometime in the future to help with projects. I feel, overall, that my page looks and behaves nicely. The page may be overall simplistic, but that does not take away from its effectiveness. My code is not exactly uniform, but it is legible to me.</p>
      <p>Starting over, I would begin by creating a plan for my page. How do I want it to look, how do I want it to behave, etc.. I went into the project with no plan for exactly what I wanted, and I feel that hindered a lot of my progress. From now on, I plan on sketching outlines and choosing color palettes ahead of time.</p>
      <p>As for the page revisions, there were two common notes: add more images to the home and history page, and reduce the letter spacing in the body sections. These are both revisions I sought to fix. I added 3 images to the home page: an external view, and two internal views. Then, I added a simple schematics image to the history page. I also added a larger space between the table columns at the bottom of the history page to make the table more readable.</p>
      <p>A few noticed lines between the repeating background on the FAQ page. Unfortunately, I could not find a good way to fix the issue that did not include blowing out the image. For this reason, that problem has remained.</p>
